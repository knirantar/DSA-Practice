Leaf node

1. Full Binary - Every node will either have 0 or 2 children
 
2. Complete Binary Tree - all levels are completely filled except the last one. The last level has all the nodes in left as possible

3. Perfect Binary Tree - All leaf nodes are at the same level

4. Balanced Binary Tree - Height of the tree is maximum at Log(n)

5. Degenerate Tree - skewed tree - like a linked list

## Traversal Techniques
1. DFS(Depth First Search)
2. BFS(Breadth First Search)

## Depth First Search
1. Inorder Traversal - Left - Root - Right
2. Preorder Traversal - Root - Left - Right
3. Postorder Traversal - Left - Right - Root

## Breadth First Search
1. Breadth First Traversal - level wise
