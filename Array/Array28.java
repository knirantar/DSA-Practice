/*
 *  You are given an integer array bloomDay, an integer m and an integer k.
 * You want to make m bouquets. To make a bouquet, you need to use k adjacent flowers from the garden.
 * The garden consists of n flowers, the ith flower will bloom in the bloomDay[i] 
 * and then can be used in exactly one bouquet.
 * Return the minimum number of days you need to wait to be able to make
 *  m bouquets from the garden. If it is impossible to make m bouquets return -1.
 * 
 * Input: bloomDay = [1,10,3,10,2], m = 3, k = 1
    Output: 3
    Explanation: Let us see what happened in the first three days. x means flower bloomed and _ means flower did not bloom in the garden.
    We need 3 bouquets each should contain 1 flower.
    After day 1: [x, _, _, _, _]   // we can only make one bouquet.
    After day 2: [x, _, _, _, x]   // we can only make two bouquets.
